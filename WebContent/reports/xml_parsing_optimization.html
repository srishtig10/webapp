<h1> XML PARSING OPTIMIZATIONS</h1>
<p>We have used two optimizations to reduce the parsing time. It took us approximately 11 minutes to parse all the files end-to-end without any optimization techniques
<p> We have used the 'Batch Insert' method with a loop count of 50 along with Prepared Statements to optimize this process. It takes approximately 2 minutes for end-to-end parsing as well as loading in database.</p>
